# NASA MissionControl App.
A NodeJS app built for a coding challenge based on the control of Mars Rovers.

# Install:
Checkout the repository, and then:
```
$ yarn install
```
*Note: yarn is currently being used for scripts inside of package.json. If you prefer npm, simply edit the scripts inside npm to use NPM.

# Run:
```
$ yarn demo // boots up the app using a demo text file for data input
// or
$ FILENAME=./src/data/[your text file here] yarn start
```

# Technical assumptions:
I've tried to make some judgement calls around error handling etc. Those assumptions are listed below:
  1 - moo
  2 - cow
